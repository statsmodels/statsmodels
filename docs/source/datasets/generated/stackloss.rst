Stack loss data
===============

Description
-----------

The stack loss plant data of Brownlee (1965) contains
21 days of measurements from a plant's oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.
The nitric oxide pollutants are captured in an absorption tower.

Notes
-----

Number of Observations - 21

Number of Variables - 4

Variable name definitions::

    STACKLOSS - 10 times the percentage of ammonia going into the plant that

    AIRFLOW   - Rate of operation of the plant
    WATERTEMP - Cooling water temperature in the absorption tower
    ACIDCONC  - Acid concentration of circulating acid minus 50 times 10.
