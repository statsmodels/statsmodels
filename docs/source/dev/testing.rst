Testing on Build Machines
-------------------------

There are currently several places that statsmodels is automatically built and tested against different dependency and Python versions and architectures. Check these logs periodically, make sure everything looks okay, and fix any failures.:

* `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/statsmodels/statsmodels/builds>`_
* `Daily testing on Ubuntu via Python(x,y) <https://code.launchpad.net/~pythonxy/+recipe/statsmodels-daily-current>`_
* `NiPy testing on SPARC Boxes <http://nipy.bic.berkeley.edu/waterfall?category=statsmodels>`_

The test coverage pages are here.

* `Coveralls <https://coveralls.io/r/statsmodels/statsmodels>`_
