Testing on Build Machines
-------------------------

There are currently several places that statsmodels is automatically built and
tested against different dependency and Python versions and architectures.
Check these logs periodically, make sure everything looks okay, and fix any
failures:

* `Azure Pipelines <https://dev.azure.com/statsmodels/statsmodels-testing/_build?definitionId=1&_a=summary>`_


The test coverage pages are here:

* `Coveralls <https://coveralls.io/github/statsmodels/statsmodels>`_
* `codecov <https://codecov.io/gh/statsmodels/statsmodels>`_

We use `Codacy <https://app.codacy.com/project/josef-pkt/statsmodels/dashboard>`_
to monitor code quality.
