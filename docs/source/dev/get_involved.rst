Get Involved
============

Where to Start?
---------------

Use grep or download a tool like `grin <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/grin>`__
to search the code for TODO notes::

    grin -i -I "*.py*" todo

This shows almost 700 TODOs in the code base right now. Feel free to inquire on
the `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pystatsmodels>`_
about any of these.

Sandbox
-------

We currently have a large amount code in the :ref:`sandbox`. The medium term
goal is to move much of this to feature branches as it gets worked on and
remove the sandbox folder. Many of these models and functions are close to
done, however, and we welcome any and all contributions to complete them,
including refactoring, documentation, and tests. These models include
generalized additive models (GAM), information theoretic models such as
maximum entropy, survival models, systems of equation models, restricted least
squares, panel data models, and time series models such as (G)ARCH.
