If you want to contribute to the development of `statsmodels` by offering a patch, contributing a
new statistical test, or developing a new model, you can find out how to do so on this page.

Submitting a Patch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So you want to submit a patch to `statsmodels` and want to know what to do. Great news. Here are the 
steps you need to take.

#. Set up your local development environment. Read up on `working with git <git_notes>`__. In particular, have a look at the section on :ref:`pull-requests`, as this is how you should get your code to us.
#. Make sure your patch includes a test! See the notes on :ref:`testing`.
#. Submit your pull request. We will review the pull request and then merge into our upstream repository.

Discussing Development

Our development conversations take place on the `statsmodels mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/pystatsmodels?hl=en>`__.
