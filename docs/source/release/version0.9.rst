Release 0.9.0
=============

Release summary
---------------

Statsmodels is using now github to store the updated documentation which
is available under
http://www.statsmodels.org/stable for the last release, and
http://www.statsmodels.org/devel/ for the development version.


**Warning**

API stability is not guaranteed for new features, although even in
this case changes will be made in a backwards compatible way if
possible. The stability of a new feature depends on how much time it
was already in statsmodels master and how much usage it has already
seen.  If there are specific known problems or limitations, then they
are mentioned in the docstrings.


The following major new features appear in this version.

Generalized linear mixed models
-------------------------------

Limited support for GLIMMIX models is now included in the genmod
module.  Binomial and Poisson models with independent random effects
can be fit using Bayesian methods (Laplace and mean field
approximations to the posterior).

Documentation
-------------



Other important improvements
----------------------------

* MICE (multiple imputation) can use regularized model fitters in the
  imputation step.



Major Bugs fixed
----------------

* see github issues

While most bugs are usability problems, there is now a new label `type-bug-wrong`
for bugs that cause that silently incorrect numbers are returned.
https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/issues?q=label%3Atype-bug-wrong+is%3Aclosed

* Refitting elastic net regularized models using the `refit=True`
  option now returns the unregularized parameters for the coefficients
  selected by the regularized fitter, as documented. #4213


Backwards incompatible changes and deprecations
-----------------------------------------------

* In MixedLM, names for the random effects variance and covariance
  parameters have changed from, e.g. G RE to G Var or G x F Cov.  This
  impacts summary output, and also may require modifications to user
  code that extracted these parameters from the fitted results object
  by name.
