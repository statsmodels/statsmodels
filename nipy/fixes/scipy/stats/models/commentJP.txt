Design Questions
----------------


naming:
  * unique class names: `Model`
  * `getsomething`: indicates a return
  * fit: use consistently as verb, not also as noun

public classes that are iterators have non public methods
  * proposal convert iterator to loop

are all one linear methods necessary?

interface:
  * leave open to allow extension to arrays, masked, structured, record arrays
	and formula
  * need extra information, such as variable names for `print` (string return)
	and plots

formula:
  *	design?
	It's not clear to me what the benefits of current formula framework are.
	It's pretty verbose. short hand notation?

How to return results?
  * result classes with largely common interface, or attached to estimator
    class as properties, or a mixture of the two?
  * residual analysis, separate or attached to estimator class
    How much does residual analysis depend on specific properties of the
    estimator? Check how much commonality.
    example sandwich estimators
  * test statistics in separate functions, so that they can also be used
    without using the estimator class?
  * presentation: return string for printing summary, plots. What is the best
    pattern?

Terminology (applies also to pymvpa)
  * some is not familiar to me
  * need glossary, translation to other commonly used statistical/econometrics
    terms
  * examples:
    - contrast: is this just a test of linear restriction, tcontrast, fcontrast
    - features: in pymvpa, are these always discrete random variables (ordinal
      or categorical)?

Use cases
  * look at some introductory usage explanations in R, SAS, ..., text books
    for example: "Econometrics with R" author?
    This is obvious for basic results, but not for additional test statistics
