What the l1 addition is
=======================
A slight modification that allows l1 regularized LikelihoodModel.

Regularization is handled by a fit_regularized method.

Main Files
==========

l1_demo/generate_test_results.py
    $ python generate_test_results.py
    will print out results that can be cut and paste into tests/results/results_discrete.py

l1_demo/demo.py
    $ python demo.py logit
    does a quick demo of the regularization using logistic regression.

l1_demo/sklearn_compare.py
    $ python sklearn_compare.py
    Plots a comparison of regularization paths.  Modify the source to use
    different datasets.

statsmodels/discrete/l1_cvxopt.py
    _fit_l1_cvxopt_cp() 
        Fit likelihood model using l1 regularization.  Use the CVXOPT package.
    Lots of small functions supporting _fit_l1_cvxopt_cp

statsmodels/discrete/l1_slsqp.py
    _fit_l1_slsqp() 
        Fit likelihood model using l1 regularization.  Use scipy.optimize
    Lots of small functions supporting _fit_l1_slsqp

statsmodels/discrete/l1_solvers_common.py
    Common methods used by l1 solvers

statsmodels/base/model.py
    Likelihoodmodel.fit() 
        3 lines modified to allow for importing and calling of l1 fitting functions

statsmodels/discrete/discrete_model.py
    L1MultinomialResults class
        Child of MultinomialResults
    MultinomialModel.fit()
        3 lines re-directing l1 fit results to the L1MultinomialResults class



What Statsmodels is
===================
What it is
==========

Statsmodels is a Python package that provides a complement to scipy for statistical computations including descriptive statistics and estimation and inference for statistical models.

Main Features
=============

* linear regression models: Generalized least squares (including weighted least squares and
  least squares with autoregressive errors), ordinary least squares.
* glm: Generalized linear models with support for all of the one-parameter
  exponential family distributions.
* discrete: regression with discrete dependent variables, including Logit, Probit, MNLogit, Poisson, based on maximum likelihood estimators
* rlm: Robust linear models with support for several M-estimators.
* tsa: models for time series analysis
  - univariate time series analysis: AR, ARIMA
  - vector autoregressive models, VAR and structural VAR
  - descriptive statistics and process models for time series analysis
* nonparametric : (Univariate) kernel density estimators
* datasets: Datasets to be distributed and used for examples and in testing.
* stats: a wide range of statistical tests
  - diagnostics and specification tests
  - goodness-of-fit and normality tests
  - functions for multiple testing
  - various additional statistical tests
* iolib
  - Tools for reading Stata .dta files into numpy arrays.
  - printing table output to ascii, latex, and html
* miscellaneous models
* sandbox: statsmodels contains a sandbox folder with code in various stages of
  developement and testing which is not considered "production ready".
  This covers among others Mixed (repeated measures) Models, GARCH models, general method
  of moments (GMM) estimators, kernel regression, various extensions to scipy.stats.distributions,
  panel data models, generalized additive models and information theoretic measures.
