On Ubuntu you can get dependencies through:

    sudo apt-get install python python-dev python-setuptools python-numpy python-scipy
    pip install cython pandas

Alternatively, you can install from the NeuroDebian repository:
    
    http://neuro.debian.net

----------------------

Download and extract the source distribution from PyPI or github

    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/statsmodels
    https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/tags

Or clone the bleeding edge code from our repository on github at
