Installing
----------

To get the latest release using pip

    pip install statsmodels --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed

The additional parameter pip --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed will ensure
that dependencies, e.g. NumPy or pandas, are not upgraded unless required.

Ubuntu/Debian
-------------

On Ubuntu you can get dependencies through:

    sudo apt-get install python python-dev python-setuptools python-numpy python-scipy
    pip install cython pandas

Alternatively, you can install from the NeuroDebian repository:
    
    http://neuro.debian.net


Installing from Source
----------------------

Download and extract the source distribution from PyPI or github

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/statsmodels
    https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/tags

Or clone the bleeding edge code from our repository on github at

    git clone git://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels.git

In the statsmodels directory do (with proper permissions)
