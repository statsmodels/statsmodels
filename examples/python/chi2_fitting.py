# # Least squares fitting of models to data

# This is a quick introduction to `statsmodels` for physical scientists
# (e.g. physicists, astronomers) or engineers.
#
# Why is this needed?
#
# Because most of `statsmodels` was written by statisticians and they use
# a different terminology and sometimes methods, making it hard to know
# which classes and functions are relevant and what their inputs and outputs
# mean.

# ## Linear models

# Assume you have data points with measurements `y` at positions `x` as
# well as measurement errors `y_err`.
#
# How can you use `statsmodels` to fit a straight line model to this data?
#
# For an extensive discussion see [Hogg et al. (2010), "Data analysis
# recipes: Fitting a model to data"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4686) ...
# we'll use the example data given by them in Table 1.
#
# So the model is `f(x) = a * x + b` and on Figure 1 they print the result
# we want to reproduce ... the best-fit parameter and the parameter errors
# for a "standard weighted least-squares fit" for this data are:
# * `a = 2.24 +- 0.11`
# * `b = 34 +- 18`

# To fit a straight line use the weighted least squares class [WLS](https:
# //www.statsmodels.org/devel/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.
# WLS.html) ... the parameters are called:
# * `exog` = `sm.add_constant(x)`
# * `endog` = `y`
# * `weights` = `1 / sqrt(y_err)`
#
# Note that `exog` must be a 2-dimensional array with `x` as a column and
# an extra column of ones. Adding this column of ones means you want to fit
# the model `y = a * x + b`, leaving it off means you want to fit the model
# `y = a * x`.
#
# And you have to use the option `cov_type='fixed scale'` to tell
# `statsmodels` that you really have measurement errors with an absolute
# scale. If you don't, `statsmodels` will treat the weights as relative
# weights between the data points and internally re-scale them so that the
# best-fit model will have `chi**2 / ndf = 1`.
