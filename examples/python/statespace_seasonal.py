# # Seasonality in time series data
#
# Consider the problem of modeling time series data with multiple seasonal
# components with different perioidicities.  Let us take the time series
# $y_t$ and decompose it explicitly to have a level component and two
# seasonal components.
#
# $$
# y_t = \mu_t + \gamma^{(1)}_t + \gamma^{(2)}_t
# $$
#
# where $\mu_t$ represents the trend or level, $\gamma^{(1)}_t$ represents
# a seasonal component with a relatively short period, and $\gamma^{(2)}_t$
# represents another seasonal component of longer period. We will have a
# fixed intercept term for our level and consider both $\gamma^{(2)}_t$ and
# $\gamma^{(2)}_t$ to be stochastic so that the seasonal patterns can vary
# over time.
#
# In this notebook, we will generate synthetic data conforming to this
# model and showcase modeling of the seasonal terms in a few different ways
# under the unobserved components modeling framework.

# ### Synthetic data creation
#
# We will create data with multiple seasonal patterns by following
# equations (3.7) and (3.8) in Durbin and Koopman (2012).  We will simulate
# 300 periods and two seasonal terms parameterized in the frequency domain
# having periods 10 and 100, respectively, and 3 and 2 number of harmonics,
# respectively.  Further, the variances of their stochastic parts are 4 and
# 9, respecively.


# First we'll simulate the synthetic data

#

# modeled as a fixed intercept and the seasonal components are modeled using
# trigonometric functions with primary periodicities of 10 and 100,
# respectively, and number of harmonics 3 and 2, respecively.  Note that
# this is the correct, generating model. The process for the time series can
# be written as:
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
# y_t & = \mu_t + \gamma^{(1)}_t + \gamma^{(2)}_t + \epsilon_t\\
# \mu_{t+1} & = \mu_t \\
# \gamma^{(1)}_{t} &= \sum_{j=1}^2 \gamma^{(1)}_{j, t} \\

# \gamma^{(1)}_{j, t+1} &= \gamma^{(1)}_{j, t}\cos(\lambda_j) + \gamma^{*,
# (1)}_{j, t}\sin(\lambda_j) + \omega^{(1)}_{j,t}, ~j = 1, 2, 3\\
# \gamma^{*, (1)}_{j, t+1} &= -\gamma^{(1)}_{j, t}\sin(\lambda_j) +
# \gamma^{*, (1)}_{j, t}\cos(\lambda_j) + \omega^{*, (1)}_{j, t}, ~j = 1, 2,

# Observe that the fitted variances are pretty close to the true variances
# of 4 and 9.  Further, the individual seasonal components look pretty close
# to the true seasonal components.  The smoothed level term is kind of close
# to the true level of 10.  Finally, our diagnostics look solid; the test
# statistics are small enough to fail to reject our three tests.

# ### Unobserved components (mixed time and frequency domain modeling)
#
# The second method is an unobserved components model, where the trend is
# modeled as a fixed intercept and the seasonal components are modeled using
# 10 constants summing to 0 and trigonometric functions with a primary
# periodicities of 100 with 2 harmonics total.  Note that this isn't the
# generating model, as it presupposes that there are more state errors for
# the shorter seasonal component than in reality. The process for the time
# series can be written as:
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
# y_t & = \mu_t + \gamma^{(1)}_t + \gamma^{(2)}_t + \epsilon_t\\
# \mu_{t+1} & = \mu_t \\
# \gamma^{(1)}_{t + 1} &= - \sum_{j=1}^9 \gamma^{(1)}_{t + 1 - j} +

# \gamma^{*, (2)}_{j, t}\cos(\lambda_j) + \omega^{*, (2)}_{j, t}, ~j = 1,
# 2\\
# \end{align}
# $$
#
# where $\epsilon_t$ is white noise, $\omega^{(1)}_{t}$ are i.i.d. $N(0,
# \sigma^2_1)$, and  $\omega^{(2)}_{j,t}$ are i.i.d. $N(0, \sigma^2_2)$.

res_tf.plot_components()
plt.show()

# The plotted components look good.  However, the estimated variance of
# the second seasonal term is inflated from reality.  Additionally, we
# reject the Ljung-Box statistic, indicating we may have remaining
# autocorrelation after accounting for our components.

# ### Unobserved components (lazy frequency domain modeling)
#
# The third method is an unobserved components model with a fixed
# intercept and one seasonal component, which is modeled using trigonometric
# functions with primary periodicity 100 and 50 harmonics. Note that this
# isn't the generating model, as it presupposes that there are more
# harmonics then in reality.  Because the variances are tied together, we
# are not able to drive the estimated covariance of the non-existent
# harmonics to 0.  What is lazy about this model specification is that we
# have not bothered to specify the two different seasonal components and
# instead chosen to model them using a single component with enough
# harmonics to cover both.  We will not be able to capture any differences
# in variances between the two true components.  The process for the time
# series can be written as:
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
# y_t & = \mu_t + \gamma^{(1)}_t + \epsilon_t\\
# \mu_{t+1} &= \mu_t\\
# \gamma^{(1)}_{t} &= \sum_{j=1}^{50}\gamma^{(1)}_{j, t}\\
# \gamma^{(1)}_{j, t+1} &= \gamma^{(1)}_{j, t}\cos(\lambda_j) + \gamma^{*,
# (1)}_{j, t}\sin(\lambda_j) + \omega^{(1}_{j,t}, ~j = 1, 2, \dots, 50\\
# \gamma^{*, (1)}_{j, t+1} &= -\gamma^{(1)}_{j, t}\sin(\lambda_j) +
# \gamma^{*, (1)}_{j, t}\cos(\lambda_j) + \omega^{*, (1)}_{j, t}, ~j = 1, 2,
# \dots, 50\\
# \end{align}
# $$
#
# where $\epsilon_t$ is white noise, $\omega^{(1)}_{t}$ are i.i.d. $N(0,
# \sigma^2_1)$.

# level.

# ### Unobserved components (lazy time domain seasonal modeling)
#
# The fourth method is an unobserved components model with a fixed
# intercept and a single seasonal component modeled using a time-domain
# seasonal model of 100 constants. The process for the time series can be
# written as:
#
# $$
# \begin{align}

# \mu_{t+1} &= \mu_{t} \\

# \omega^{(1)}_t\\

# \sigma^2_1)$.

# The seasonal component itself looks good--it is the primary singal.  The
# estimated variance of the seasonal term is very high ($>10^5$), leading to
# a lot of uncertainty in our one-step-ahead predictions and slow
# responsiveness to new data, as evidenced by large errors in one-step ahead
# predictions and observations. Finally, all three of our diagnostic tests
# were rejected.

# ### Comparison of filtered estimates
#
# The plots below show that explicitly modeling the individual components
# results in the filtered state being close to the true state within roughly
# half a period.  The lazy models took longer (almost a full period) to do
# the same on the combined true state.

# ##### Conclusions
#
# In this notebook, we simulated a time series with two seasonal
# components of different periods.  We modeled them using structural time
# series models with (a) two frequency domain components of correct periods
# and numbers of harmonics, (b) time domain seasonal component for the
# shorter term and a frequency domain term with correct period and number of
# harmonics, (c) a single frequency domain term with the longer period and
# full number of harmonics, and (d) a single time domain term with the
# longer period.  We saw a variety of diagnostic results, with only the
# correct generating model, (a), failing to reject any of the tests.  Thus,
# more flexible seasonal modeling allowing for multiple components with
# specifiable harmonics can be a useful tool for time series modeling.
# Finally, we can represent seasonal components with fewer total states in
# this way, allowing for the user to attempt to make the bias-variance
# tradeoff themselves instead of being forced to choose "lazy" models, which
# use a large number of states and incur additional variance as a result.
