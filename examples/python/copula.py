# When modeling a system, there are often cases where multiple parameters
# are involved. Each of these parameters could be described with a given
# Probability Density Function (PDF). If would like to be able to generate a
# new set of parameter values, we need to be able to sample from these
# distributions-also called marginals. There are mainly two cases: *(i)*
# PDFs are independent; *(ii)* there is a dependency. One way to model the
# dependency it to use a **copula**.

# ## Sampling from a copula
#
# Let's use a bi-variate example and assume first that we have a prior and
# know how to model the dependence between our 2 variables.
#
# In this case, we are using the Gumbel copula and fix its hyperparameter
# `theta=2`. We can visualize it's 2-dimensional PDF.

from statsmodels.distributions.copula.api import CopulaDistribution, GumbelCopula

copula = GumbelCopula(theta=2)
_ = copula.plot_pdf()  # returns a matplotlib figure

# And we can sample the PDF.

sample = copula.rvs(10000)
h = sns.jointplot(x=sample[:, 0], y=sample[:, 1], kind="hex")
_ = h.set_axis_labels("X1", "X2", fontsize=16)

# Let's come back to our 2 variables for a second. In this case we
# consider them to be gamma and normally distributed. If they would be
# independent from each other, we could sample from each PDF individually.
# Here we use a convenient class to do the same operation.
#
# ### Reproducibility
#
# Generating reproducible random values from copulas required explicitly
# setting the `seed` argument.
# `seed` accepts either an initialized NumPy `Generator` or `RandomState`,
# or any argument acceptable
# to `np.random.default_rng`, e.g., an integer or a sequence of integers.
# This example uses an
# integer.
#
# The singleton `RandomState` that is directly exposed in the `np.random`
# distributions is
# not used, and setting `np.random.seed` has no effect on the values
# generated.

marginals = [stats.gamma(2), stats.norm]
joint_dist = CopulaDistribution(marginals=marginals, copula=None)
sample = joint_dist.rvs(512, random_state=20210801)
h = sns.jointplot(x=sample[:, 0], y=sample[:, 1], kind="scatter")
_ = h.set_axis_labels("X1", "X2", fontsize=16)

# Now, above we have expressed the dependency between our variables using
# a copula, we can use this copula to sample a new set of observation with
# the same convenient class.

joint_dist = CopulaDistribution(marginals=marginals, copula=copula)
# Use an initialized Generator object
rng = np.random.default_rng([2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 8, 0, 1])
sample = joint_dist.rvs(512, random_state=rng)
h = sns.jointplot(x=sample[:, 0], y=sample[:, 1], kind="scatter")
_ = h.set_axis_labels("X1", "X2", fontsize=16)

# There are two things to note here. *(i)* as in the independent case, the
# marginals are correctly showing a gamma and normal distribution; *(ii)*
# the dependence is visible between the two variables.

# ## Estimating copula parameters
#
# Now, imagine we already have experimental data and we know that there is
# a dependency that can be expressed using a Gumbel copula. But we don't
# know what is the hyperparameter value for our copula. In this case, we can
# estimate the value.
#
# We are going to use the sample we just generated as we already know the
# value of the hyperparameter we should get: `theta=2`.

copula = GumbelCopula()
theta = copula.fit_corr_param(sample)
print(theta)

# We can see that the estimated hyperparameter value is close to the value
# set previously.
