# # SARIMAX: Introduction

# This notebook replicates examples from the Stata ARIMA time series
# estimation and postestimation documentation.
#
# First, we replicate the four estimation examples
# http://www.stata.com/manuals13/tsarima.pdf:
#
# 1. ARIMA(1,1,1) model on the U.S. Wholesale Price Index (WPI) dataset.
# 2. Variation of example 1 which adds an MA(4) term to the ARIMA(1,1,1)
# specification to allow for an additive seasonal effect.
# 3. ARIMA(2,1,0) x (1,1,0,12) model of monthly airline data. This example
# allows a multiplicative seasonal effect.
# 4. ARMA(1,1) model with exogenous regressors; describes consumption as
# an autoregressive process on which also the money supply is assumed to be
# an explanatory variable.
#
# Second, we demonstrate postestimation capabilitites to replicate
# http://www.stata.com/manuals13/tsarimapostestimation.pdf. The model from
# example 4 is used to demonstrate:
#
# 1. One-step-ahead in-sample prediction
# 2. n-step-ahead out-of-sample forecasting
# 3. n-step-ahead in-sample dynamic prediction

# ### ARIMA Example 1: Arima
#
# As can be seen in the graphs from Example 2, the Wholesale price index
# (WPI) is growing over time (i.e. is not stationary). Therefore an ARMA
# model is not a good specification. In this first example, we consider a
# model where the original time series is assumed to be integrated of order
# 1, so that the difference is assumed to be stationary, and fit a model
# with one autoregressive lag and one moving average lag, as well as an
# intercept term.
#
# The postulated data process is then:
#
# $$
# \Delta y_t = c + \phi_1 \Delta y_{t-1} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} +
# \epsilon_{t}
# $$
#
# where $c$ is the intercept of the ARMA model, $\Delta$ is the first-
# difference operator, and we assume $\epsilon_{t} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$.
# This can be rewritten to emphasize lag polynomials as (this will be useful
# in example 2, below):
#
# $$
# (1 - \phi_1 L ) \Delta y_t = c + (1 + \theta_1 L) \epsilon_{t}
# $$
#
# where $L$ is the lag operator.
#
# Notice that one difference between the Stata output and the output below
# is that Stata estimates the following model:
#
# $$
# (\Delta y_t - \beta_0) = \phi_1 ( \Delta y_{t-1} - \beta_0) + \theta_1
# \epsilon_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t}
# $$
#
# where $\beta_0$ is the mean of the process $y_t$. This model is
# equivalent to the one estimated in the Statsmodels SARIMAX class, but the
# interpretation is different. To see the equivalence, note that:
#
# $$
# (\Delta y_t - \beta_0) = \phi_1 ( \Delta y_{t-1} - \beta_0) + \theta_1
# \epsilon_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t} \\
# \Delta y_t = (1 - \phi_1) \beta_0 + \phi_1 \Delta y_{t-1} + \theta_1
# \epsilon_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t}
# $$
#
# so that $c = (1 - \phi_1) \beta_0$.

# Dataset
wpi1 = requests.get('https://www.stata-press.com/data/r12/wpi1.dta').content
data = pd.read_stata(BytesIO(wpi1))
data.index = data.t

# Fit the model
mod = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(data['wpi'], trend='c', order=(1, 1, 1))
res = mod.fit(disp=False)
print(res.summary())

# Thus the maximum likelihood estimates imply that for the process above,
# we have:
#
# $$
# \Delta y_t = 0.1050 + 0.8740 \Delta y_{t-1} - 0.4206 \epsilon_{t-1} +
# \epsilon_{t}
# $$
#
# where $\epsilon_{t} \sim N(0, 0.5226)$. Finally, recall that $c = (1 -
# \phi_1) \beta_0$, and here $c = 0.1050$ and $\phi_1 = 0.8740$. To compare
# with the output from Stata, we could calculate the mean:
#
# $$\beta_0 = \frac{c}{1 - \phi_1} = \frac{0.1050}{1 - 0.8740} = 0.83$$
#
# **Note**: these values are slightly different from the values in the
# Stata documentation because the optimizer in Statsmodels has found
# parameters here that yield a higher likelihood. Nonetheless, they are very
# close.

# ### ARIMA Example 2: Arima with additive seasonal effects
#
# This model is an extension of that from example 1. Here the data is
# assumed to follow the process:
#
# $$
# \Delta y_t = c + \phi_1 \Delta y_{t-1} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} +
# \theta_4 \epsilon_{t-4} + \epsilon_{t}
# $$
#
# The new part of this model is that there is allowed to be a annual
# seasonal effect (it is annual even though the periodicity is 4 because the
# dataset is quarterly). The second difference is that this model uses the
# log of the data rather than the level.
#
# Before estimating the dataset, graphs showing:
#
# 1. The time series (in logs)
# 2. The first difference of the time series (in logs)
# 3. The autocorrelation function
# 4. The partial autocorrelation function.
#
# From the first two graphs, we note that the original time series does
# not appear to be stationary, whereas the first-difference does. This
# supports either estimating an ARMA model on the first-difference of the
# data, or estimating an ARIMA model with 1 order of integration (recall
# that we are taking the latter approach). The last two graphs support the
# use of an ARMA(1,1,1) model.

# Dataset
data = pd.read_stata(BytesIO(wpi1))
data.index = data.t
data['ln_wpi'] = np.log(data['wpi'])
data['D.ln_wpi'] = data['ln_wpi'].diff()

# Graph data
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 4))

# Levels
axes[0].plot(data.index._mpl_repr(), data['wpi'], '-')
axes[0].set(title='US Wholesale Price Index')

# Log difference
axes[1].plot(data.index._mpl_repr(), data['D.ln_wpi'], '-')
axes[1].hlines(0, data.index[0], data.index[-1], 'r')
axes[1].set(title='US Wholesale Price Index - difference of logs')

# Graph data
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 4))

fig = sm.graphics.tsa.plot_acf(data.iloc[1:]['D.ln_wpi'], lags=40, ax=axes[0])
fig = sm.graphics.tsa.plot_pacf(data.iloc[1:]['D.ln_wpi'], lags=40, ax=axes[1])

# To understand how to specify this model in Statsmodels, first recall
# that from example 1 we used the following code to specify the ARIMA(1,1,1)
# model:
#
# ```python
# mod = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(data['wpi'], trend='c', order=(1,1,1))
# ```
#
# The `order` argument is a tuple of the form `(AR specification,
# Integration order, MA specification)`. The integration order must be an
# integer (for example, here we assumed one order of integration, so it was
# specified as 1. In a pure ARMA model where the underlying data is already
# stationary, it would be 0).
#
# For the AR specification and MA specification components, there are two
# possiblities. The first is to specify the **maximum degree** of the
# corresponding lag polynomial, in which case the component is an integer.
# For example, if we wanted to specify an ARIMA(1,1,4) process, we would
# use:
#
# ```python
# mod = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(data['wpi'], trend='c', order=(1,1,4))
# ```
#
# and the corresponding data process would be:
#
# $$
# y_t = c + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2
# \epsilon_{t-2} + \theta_3 \epsilon_{t-3} + \theta_4 \epsilon_{t-4} +
# \epsilon_{t}
# $$
#
# or
#
# $$
# (1 - \phi_1 L)\Delta y_t = c + (1 + \theta_1 L + \theta_2 L^2 + \theta_3
# L^3 + \theta_4 L^4) \epsilon_{t}
# $$
#
# When the specification parameter is given as a maximum degree of the lag
# polynomial, it implies that all polynomial terms up to that degree are
# included. Notice that this is *not* the model we want to use, because it
# would include terms for $\epsilon_{t-2}$ and $\epsilon_{t-3}$, which we
# don't want here.
#
# What we want is a polynomial that has terms for the 1st and 4th degrees,
# but leaves out the 2nd and 3rd terms. To do that, we need to provide a
# tuple for the specifiation parameter, where the tuple describes **the lag
# polynomial itself**. In particular, here we would want to use:
#
# ```python
# ar = 1          # this is the maximum degree specification
# ma = (1,0,0,1)  # this is the lag polynomial specification
# mod = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(data['wpi'], trend='c',
# order=(ar,1,ma)))
# ```
#
# This gives the following form for the process of the data:
#
# $$
# \Delta y_t = c + \phi_1 \Delta y_{t-1} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} +
# \theta_4 \epsilon_{t-4} + \epsilon_{t} \\
# (1 - \phi_1 L)\Delta y_t = c + (1 + \theta_1 L + \theta_4 L^4)
# \epsilon_{t}
# $$
#
# which is what we want.

# Fit the model
mod = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(data['ln_wpi'], trend='c', order=(1, 1, 1))
res = mod.fit(disp=False)
print(res.summary())

# ### ARIMA Example 3: Airline Model
#
# In the previous example, we included a seasonal effect in an *additive*
# way, meaning that we added a term allowing the process to depend on the
# 4th MA lag. It may be instead that we want to model a seasonal effect in a
# multiplicative way. We often write the model then as an ARIMA $(p,d,q)
# \times (P,D,Q)_s$, where the lowercast letters indicate the specification
# for the non-seasonal component, and the uppercase letters indicate the
# specification for the seasonal component; $s$ is the periodicity of the
# seasons (e.g. it is often 4 for quarterly data or 12 for monthly data).
# The data process can be written generically as:
#
# $$
# \phi_p (L) \tilde \phi_P (L^s) \Delta^d \Delta_s^D y_t = A(t) + \theta_q
# (L) \tilde \theta_Q (L^s) \epsilon_t
# $$
#
# where:
#
# - $\phi_p (L)$ is the non-seasonal autoregressive lag polynomial
# - $\tilde \phi_P (L^s)$ is the seasonal autoregressive lag polynomial
# - $\Delta^d \Delta_s^D y_t$ is the time series, differenced $d$ times,
# and seasonally differenced $D$ times.
# - $A(t)$ is the trend polynomial (including the intercept)
# - $\theta_q (L)$ is the non-seasonal moving average lag polynomial
# - $\tilde \theta_Q (L^s)$ is the seasonal moving average lag polynomial
#
# sometimes we rewrite this as:
#
# $$
# \phi_p (L) \tilde \phi_P (L^s) y_t^* = A(t) + \theta_q (L) \tilde
# \theta_Q (L^s) \epsilon_t
# $$
#
# where $y_t^* = \Delta^d \Delta_s^D y_t$. This emphasizes that just as in
# the simple case, after we take differences (here both non-seasonal and
# seasonal) to make the data stationary, the resulting model is just an ARMA
# model.
#
# As an example, consider the airline model ARIMA $(2,1,0) \times
# (1,1,0)_{12}$, with an intercept. The data process can be written in the
# form above as:
#
# $$
# (1 - \phi_1 L - \phi_2 L^2) (1 - \tilde \phi_1 L^{12}) \Delta
# \Delta_{12} y_t = c + \epsilon_t
# $$
#
# Here, we have:
#
# - $\phi_p (L) = (1 - \phi_1 L - \phi_2 L^2)$
# - $\tilde \phi_P (L^s) = (1 - \phi_1 L^12)$
# - $d = 1, D = 1, s=12$ indicating that $y_t^*$ is derived from $y_t$ by
# taking first-differences and then taking 12-th differences.
# - $A(t) = c$ is the *constant* trend polynomial (i.e. just an intercept)
# - $\theta_q (L) = \tilde \theta_Q (L^s) = 1$ (i.e. there is no moving
# average effect)
#
# It may still be confusing to see the two lag polynomials in front of the
# time-series variable, but notice that we can multiply the lag polynomials
# together to get the following model:
#
# $$
# (1 - \phi_1 L - \phi_2 L^2 - \tilde \phi_1 L^{12} + \phi_1 \tilde \phi_1
# L^{13} + \phi_2 \tilde \phi_1 L^{14} ) y_t^* = c + \epsilon_t
# $$
#
# which can be rewritten as:
#
# $$
# y_t^* = c + \phi_1 y_{t-1}^* + \phi_2 y_{t-2}^* + \tilde \phi_1
# y_{t-12}^* - \phi_1 \tilde \phi_1 y_{t-13}^* - \phi_2 \tilde \phi_1
# y_{t-14}^* + \epsilon_t
# $$
#
# This is similar to the additively seasonal model from example 2, but the
# coefficients in front of the autoregressive lags are actually combinations
# of the underlying seasonal and non-seasonal parameters.
#
# Specifying the model in Statsmodels is done simply by adding the
# `seasonal_order` argument, which accepts a tuple of the form `(Seasonal AR
# specification, Seasonal Integration order, Seasonal MA, Seasonal
# periodicity)`. The seasonal AR and MA specifications, as before, can be
# expressed as a maximum polynomial degree or as the lag polynomial itself.
# Seasonal periodicity is an integer.
#
# For the airline model ARIMA $(2,1,0) \times (1,1,0)_{12}$ with an
# intercept, the command is:
#
# ```python
# mod = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(data['lnair'], order=(2,1,0),
# seasonal_order=(1,1,0,12))
# ```

# Dataset
air2 = requests.get('https://www.stata-press.com/data/r12/air2.dta').content
data = pd.read_stata(BytesIO(air2))
data.index = pd.date_range(
    start=datetime(data.time[0], 1, 1), periods=len(data), freq='MS')
data['lnair'] = np.log(data['air'])

# Fit the model
mod = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(
    data['lnair'],
    order=(2, 1, 0),
    seasonal_order=(1, 1, 0, 12),
    simple_differencing=True)
res = mod.fit(disp=False)
print(res.summary())

# Notice that here we used an additional argument
# `simple_differencing=True`. This controls how the order of integration is
# handled in ARIMA models. If `simple_differencing=True`, then the time
# series provided as `endog` is literatlly differenced and an ARMA model is
# fit to the resulting new time series. This implies that a number of
# initial periods are lost to the differencing process, however it may be
# necessary either to compare results to other packages (e.g. Stata's
# `arima` always uses  simple differencing) or if the seasonal periodicity
# is large.
#
# The default is `simple_differencing=False`, in which case the
# integration component is implemented as part of the state space
# formulation, and all of the original data can be used in estimation.

# ### ARIMA Example 4: ARMAX (Friedman)
#
# This model demonstrates the use of explanatory variables (the X part of
# ARMAX). When exogenous regressors are included, the SARIMAX module uses
# the concept of "regression with SARIMA errors" (see
# http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/arimax/ for details of regression with
# ARIMA errors versus alternative specifications), so that the model is
# specified as:
#
# $$
# y_t = \beta_t x_t + u_t \\
#         \phi_p (L) \tilde \phi_P (L^s) \Delta^d \Delta_s^D u_t = A(t) +
#             \theta_q (L) \tilde \theta_Q (L^s) \epsilon_t
# $$
#
# Notice that the first equation is just a linear regression, and the
# second equation just describes the process followed by the error component
# as SARIMA (as was described in example 3). One reason for this
# specification is that the estimated parameters have their natural
# interpretations.
#
# This specification nests many simpler specifications. For example,
# regression with AR(2) errors is:
#
# $$
# y_t = \beta_t x_t + u_t \\
# (1 - \phi_1 L - \phi_2 L^2) u_t = A(t) + \epsilon_t
# $$
#
# The model considered in this example is regression with ARMA(1,1)
# errors. The process is then written:
#
# $$
# \text{consump}_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{m2}_t + u_t \\
# (1 - \phi_1 L) u_t = (1 - \theta_1 L) \epsilon_t
# $$
#
# Notice that $\beta_0$ is, as described in example 1 above, *not* the
# same thing as an intercept specified by `trend='c'`. Whereas in the
# examples above we estimated the intercept of the model via the trend
# polynomial, here, we demonstrate how to estimate $\beta_0$ itself by
# adding a constant to the exogenous dataset. In the output, the $beta_0$ is
# called `const`, whereas above the intercept $c$ was called `intercept` in
# the output.

# ### ARIMA Postestimation: Example 1 - Dynamic Forecasting
#
# Here we describe some of the post-estimation capabilities of
# Statsmodels' SARIMAX.
#
# First, using the model from example, we estimate the parameters using
# data that *excludes the last few observations* (this is a little
# artificial as an example, but it allows considering performance of out-of-
# sample forecasting and facilitates comparison to Stata's documentation).

# Dataset

# Next, we want to get results for the full dataset but using the
# estimated parameters (on a subset of the data).

mod = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(endog, exog=exog, order=(1, 0, 1))
res = mod.filter(fit_res.params)

# The `predict` command is first applied here to get in-sample
# predictions. We use the `full_results=True` argument to allow us to
# calculate confidence intervals (the default output of `predict` is just
# the predicted values).
#
# With no other arguments, `predict` returns the one-step-ahead in-sample
# predictions for the entire sample.

# In-sample one-step-ahead predictions
predict = res.get_prediction()
predict_ci = predict.conf_int()

# We can also get *dynamic predictions*. One-step-ahead prediction uses
# the true values of the endogenous values at each step to predict the next
# in-sample value. Dynamic predictions use one-step-ahead prediction up to
# some point in the dataset (specified by the `dynamic` argument); after
# that, the previous *predicted* endogenous values are used in place of the
# true endogenous values for each new predicted element.
#
# The `dynamic` argument is specified to be an *offset* relative to the
# `start` argument. If `start` is not specified, it is assumed to be `0`.
#
# Here we perform dynamic prediction starting in the first quarter of
# 1978.
