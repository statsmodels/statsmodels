    "# Tukey's multiple comparisons tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tukey Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test is a widely used post hoc analysis method for identifying which specific group means differ significantly after obtaining a statistically significant result from an ANOVA. While ANOVA can tell us that at least one group is different, it doesn't indicate which ones. The pairwise_tukeyhsd function in statsmodels fills this gap by performing all possible pairwise comparisons between group means while controlling the family-wise error rate. This makes it especially valuable when analysing categorical factors with three or more levels, allowing for detailed interpretation of group differences while maintaining statistical rigour."
