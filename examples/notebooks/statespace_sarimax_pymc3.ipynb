    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show how to use fast Bayesian methods to estimate SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) models. These methods can also be parallelized across multiple cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, fast methods means a version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo called the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) developed by Hoffmann and Gelman: see [Hoffman, M. D., & Gelman, A. (2014). The No-U-Turn sampler: adaptively setting path lengths in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 15(1), 1593-1623.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4246). As they say, \"the cost of HMC per independent sample from a target distribution of dimension $D$ is roughly $\\mathcal{O}(D^{5/4})$, which stands in sharp contrast with the $\\mathcal{O}(D^{2})$ cost of random-walk Metropolis\". So for problems of larger dimension, the time-saving with HMC is significant. However it does require the gradient, or Jacobian, of the model to be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will combine the Python libraries [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), which does econometrics, and [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/), which is for Bayesian estimation, to perform fast Bayesian estimation of a simple SARIMAX model, in this case an ARMA(1, 1) model for US CPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, for simple models like AR(p), base PyMC3 is a quicker way to fit a model; there's an [example here](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/AR.html). The advantage of using statsmodels is that it gives access to methods that can solve a vast range of statespace models.\n",

To do all of this, it is built on top of a Theano, a library that aims to evaluate tensors very efficiently and provide symbolic differentiation (necessary for any kind of deep learning). It is the symbolic differentiation that means PyMC3 can use NUTS on any problem formulated within PyMC3.\n",
