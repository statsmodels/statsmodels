Variances terms are typically squared (to force them to be positive), and AR lag coefficients are often constrained to lead to a stationary model. `untransform_params` is used for the reverse operation (and is important because starting parameters are usually specified in terms of values appropriate to the model, and we need to convert them to parameters appropriate to the optimizer before we can begin the optimization routine).\n",
