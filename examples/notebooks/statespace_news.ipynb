    "Forecasting exercises often start with a fixed set of historical data that is used for model selection and parameter estimation. Then, the fitted selected model (or models) can be used to create out-of-sample forecasts. Most of the time, this is not the end of the story. As new data comes in, you may need to evaluate your forecast errors, possibly update your models, and create updated out-of-sample forecasts. This is sometimes called a \"real-time\" forecasting exercise (by contrast, a pseudo real-time exercise is one in which you simulate this procedure).\n",
    "\n",
    "If all that matters is minimizing some loss function based on forecast errors (like MSE), then when new data comes in you may just want to completely redo model selection, parameter estimation and out-of-sample forecasting, using the updated datapoints. If you do this, your new forecasts will have changed for two reasons:\n",

The way we do this comes from the so-called \"nowcasting\" literature, and in particular Bańbura, Giannone, and Reichlin (2011), Bańbura and Modugno (2014), and Bańbura et al. (2014). They describe this exercise as computing the \"**news**\", and we follow them in using this language in Statsmodels.\n",
