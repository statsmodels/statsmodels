    "In this notebook, we simulated a time series with two seasonal components of different periods.  We modeled them using structural time series models with (a) two frequency domain components of correct periods and numbers of harmonics, (b) time domain seasonal component for the shorter term and a frequency domain term with correct period and number of harmonics, (c) a single frequency domain term with the longer period and full number of harmonics, and (d) a single time domain term with the longer period.  We saw a variety of diagnostic results, with only the correct generating model, (a), failing to reject any of the tests.  Thus, more flexible seasonal modeling allowing for multiple components with specifiable harmonics can be a useful tool for time series modeling.  Finally, we can represent seasonal components with fewer total states in this way, allowing for the user to attempt to make the bias-variance tradeoff themselves instead of being forced to choose \"lazy\" models, which use a large number of states and incur additional variance as a result."
