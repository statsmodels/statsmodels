    A class representing a fitted solution path that is obtained using
    regularized regression.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    model : object
        The model for which the solution path is to be constructed.
    wt_vec : array-like
        The penalty weights for the model coefficients are
        obtained by multiplying this vector by a scalar
        penalty weight.
    pwts : array-like
        The sequence of penalty weights that determine where the
        solution path is calculated
    ix_nonzero : list of arrays
        The indices of the positions where the estimated coefficients
        are nonzero.
    nonzero_params : list of arrays
        The values of the nonzero estimated coefficients.

    Notes:
    ------
    `pwts`, `ix_nonzero`, `ix_zero`, and `nonzero_params` all have
    the same number of elements.  Corresponding positions in these
    lists correspond to a single regularized fit using the given
    penalty weight.

    Extra parameters may not be regularized (this depends on how
    fit_regularized is implemented in a particular model).  They will
    still be included on the solution path.
