'''runstest

formulas for mean and var of runs taken from SAS manual NPAR tests, also idea
for runstest_1samp and runstest_2samp

Description in NIST handbook and dataplot doesn't explain their expected
values, or variance

Note:
There are (at least) two definitions of runs used in literature. The classical
definition which is also used here, is that runs are sequences of identical
observations separated by observations with different realizations.
The second definition allows for overlapping runs, or runs where counting a
run is also started after a run of a fixed length of the same kind.

* add one-sided tests where possible or where it makes sense

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, 1d
        data array,


    Notes
    -----
    This was written as a more general class for runs. This has some redundant
    calculations when only the runs_test is used.

    TODO: make it lazy

    The runs test could be generalized to more than 1d if there is a use case
    for it.

    This should be extended once I figure out what the distribution of runs
    of any length k is.

    The exact distribution for the runs test is also available but not yet
    verified.

    Notes
    -----
    Wald-Wolfowitz runs test.

    If there are ties, then then the test statistic and p-value that is
    reported, is based on the higher p-value between sorting all tied
    observations of the same group


    This test is intended for continuous distributions
    SAS has treatment for ties, but not clear, and sounds more complicated
    (minimum and maximum possible runs prvent use of argsort)
    (maybe it's not so difficult, idea: add small positive noise to first
    one, run test, then to the other, run test, take max(?) p-value - DONE
    This gives not the minimum and maximum of the number of runs, but should
    be close. Not true, this is close to minimum but far away from maximum.
    maximum number of runs would use alternating groups in the ties.)
    Maybe adding random noise would be the better approach.

    SAS has exact distribution for sample size <=30, doesn't look standard
    but should be easy to add.
