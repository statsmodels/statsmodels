    LOWESS (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing)

    A lowess function that outs smoothed estimates of endog
    at the given exog values from points (exog, endog)

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : 1-D numpy array
        The y-values of the observed points
    exog : 1-D numpy array
        The x-values of the observed points. exog has to be increasing.
    weights : 1-D numpy array
        The weightings of the observed points
    frac : float
        Between 0 and 1. The fraction of the data used
        when estimating each y-value.
    it : int
        The number of residual-based reweightings
        to perform.
    delta : float
        Distance within which to use linear-interpolation
        instead of weighted regression.
    given_xvals : bool
        Whether xvals was provided as a an argument or whether
        we are just using xvals = exog

    Returns
    -------
    out : numpy array
        A numpy array with two columns. The first column
        is the sorted x values and the second column the
        associated estimated y-values.
    resid_weights: numpy array
        A numpy array with the residual weights on the data points
        computed from the iterations performed

    Notes
    -----
    This lowess function implements the algorithm given in the
    reference below using local linear estimates.

    Suppose the input data has N points. The algorithm works by
    estimating the `smooth` y_i by taking the frac*N closest points
    to (x_i,y_i) based on their x values and estimating y_i
    using a weighted linear regression. The weight for (x_j,y_j)
    is tricube function applied to |x_i-x_j|.

    If it > 1, then further weighted local linear regressions
    are performed, where the weights are the same as above
    times the _lowess_bisquare function of the residuals. Each iteration
    takes approximately the same amount of time as the original fit,
    so these iterations are expensive. They are most useful when
    the noise has extremely heavy tails, such as Cauchy noise.
    Noise with less heavy-tails, such as t-distributions with df>2,
    are less problematic. The weights downgrade the influence of
    points with large residuals. In the extreme case, points whose
    residuals are larger than 6 times the median absolute residual
    are given weight 0.

    delta can be used to save computations. For each x_i, regressions
    are skipped for points closer than delta. The next regression is
    fit for the farthest point within delta of x_i and all points in
    between are estimated by linearly interpolating between the two
    regression fits.

    Judicious choice of delta can cut computation time considerably
    for large data (N > 5000). A good choice is delta = 0.01 *
    range(exog).

    Some experimentation is likely required to find a good
    choice of frac and iter for a particular dataset.

    Examples
    --------
    The below allows a comparison between how different the fits from
    lowess for different values of frac can be.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import statsmodels.api as sm
    >>> lowess = sm.nonparametric.lowess
    >>> x = np.random.uniform(low = -2*np.pi, high = 2*np.pi, size=500)
    >>> y = np.sin(x) + np.random.normal(size=len(x))
    >>> z = lowess(y, x)
    >>> w = lowess(y, x, frac=1./3)

    This gives a similar comparison for when it is 0 vs not.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import scipy.stats as stats
    >>> import statsmodels.api as sm
    >>> lowess = sm.nonparametric.lowess
    >>> x = np.random.uniform(low = -2*np.pi, high = 2*np.pi, size=500)
    >>> y = np.sin(x) + stats.cauchy.rvs(size=len(x))
    >>> z = lowess(y, x, frac= 1./3, it=0)
    >>> w = lowess(y, x, frac=1./3)
