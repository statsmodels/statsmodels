class KDEUnivariate(object):
    """
    Univariate Kernel Density Estimator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : array_like
        The variable for which the density estimate is desired.

    Notes
    -----
    If cdf, sf, cumhazard, or entropy are computed, they are computed based on
    the definition of the kernel rather than the FFT approximation, even if
    the density is fit with FFT = True.

    `KDEUnivariate` is much faster than `KDEMultivariate`, due to its FFT-based
    implementation.  It should be preferred for univariate, continuous data.
    `KDEMultivariate` also supports mixed data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        kernel : str
            The Kernel to be used. Choices are:

            - "biw" for biweight
            - "cos" for cosine
            - "epa" for Epanechnikov

            - "triw" for triweight
            - "uni" for uniform

        bw : str, float
            The bandwidth to use. Choices are:

            - "scott" - 1.059 * A * nobs ** (-1/5.), where A is
              `min(std(X),IQR/1.34)`
            - "silverman" - .9 * A * nobs ** (-1/5.), where A is
              `min(std(X),IQR/1.34)`
            - "normal_reference" - C * A * nobs ** (-1/5.), where C is
              calculated from the kernel. Equivalent (up to 2 dp) to the
              "scott" bandwidth for gaussian kernels. See bandwidths.py
            - If a float is given, it is the bandwidth.

        fft : bool
            Whether or not to use FFT. FFT implementation is more
            computationally efficient. However, only the Gaussian kernel
            is implemented. If FFT is False, then a 'nobs' x 'gridsize'

            -/+ cut*bw*{min(X) or max(X)}

    Only the default kernel is implemented. Weights are not implemented yet.
    This follows Silverman (1982) with changes suggested by Jones and Lotwick
    (1984). However, the discretization step is replaced by linear binning
    of Fan and Marron (1994). This should be extended to accept the parts
    that are dependent only on the data to speed things up for
    cross-validation.
