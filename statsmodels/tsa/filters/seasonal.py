    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like
        Time series
    model : str {"additive", "multiplicative"}
        Type of seasonal component. Abbreviations are accepted.
    filt : array-like
        The filter coefficients for filtering out the seasonal component.
        The default is a symmetric moving average.
    freq : int, optional
        Frequency of the series. Must be used if X is not a pandas
        object with a timeseries index.

    Returns
    -------
    results : obj
        A object with seasonal, trend, and resid attributes.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a naive decomposition. More sophisticated methods should
    be preferred.

    The additive model is Y[t] = T[t] + S[t] + e[t]

    The multiplicative model is Y[t] = T[t] * S[t] * e[t]

    The seasonal component is first removed by applying a convolution
    filter to the data. The average of this smoothed series for each
    period is the returned seasonal component.
