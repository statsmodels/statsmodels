"""Statistical power, solving for nobs, ... - trial version

Created on Sat Jan 12 21:48:06 2013

Author: Josef Perktold

Example
roundtrip - root with respect to all variables

       calculated, desired
nobs   33.367204205 33.367204205
effect 0.5 0.5
alpha  0.05 0.05
power   0.8 0.8


TODO:
refactoring
 - rename beta -> power,    beta (type 2 error is beta = 1-power)  DONE
 - I think the current implementation can handle any kinds of extra keywords
   (except for maybe raising meaningful exceptions
 - streamline code, I think internally classes can be merged
   how to extend to k-sample tests?
   user interface for different tests that map to the same (internal) test class
 - sequence of arguments might be inconsistent,
   arg and/or kwds so python checks what's required and what can be None.
 - templating for docstrings ?

    Parameters
    ----------
    effect_size : float
        standardized effect size, mean divided by the standard deviation.
        effect size has to be positive.
    df_num : int or float
        numerator degrees of freedom.
    df_denom : int or float
        denominator degrees of freedom.
    alpha : float in interval (0,1)
        significance level, e.g. 0.05, is the probability of a type I
        error, that is wrong rejections if the Null Hypothesis is true.
    ncc : int
        degrees of freedom correction for non-centrality parameter.
        see Notes

    Returns
    -------
    power : float
        Power of the test, e.g. 0.8, is one minus the probability of a
        type II error. Power is the probability that the test correctly
        rejects the Null Hypothesis if the Alternative Hypothesis is true.

    Notes
    -----

    sample size is given implicitly by df_num

    set ncc=0 to match t-test, or f-test in LikelihoodModelResults.
    ncc=1 matches the non-centrality parameter in R::pwr::pwr.f2.test

    ftest_power with ncc=0 should also be correct for f_test in regression
    models, with df_num and d_denom as defined there. (not verified yet)

        Parameters
        ----------
        dep_var : string in ['nobs', 'effect_size', 'alpha']
            This specifies which variable is used for the horizontal axis.
            If dep_var='nobs' (default), then one curve is created for each
            value of ``effect_size``. If dep_var='effect_size' or alpha, then
            one curve is created for each value of ``nobs``.
        nobs : scalar or array_like
            specifies the values of the number of observations in the plot
        effect_size : scalar or array_like
            specifies the values of the effect_size in the plot
        alpha : float or array_like
            The significance level (type I error) used in the power
            calculation. Can only be more than a scalar, if ``dep_var='alpha'``
        ax : None or axis instance
            If ax is None, than a matplotlib figure is created. If ax is a
            matplotlib axis instance, then it is reused, and the plot elements
            are created with it.
        title : string
            title for the axis. Use an empty string, ``''``, to avoid a title.
        plt_kwds : None or dict
            not used yet
        kwds : optional keywords for power function
            These remaining keyword arguments are used as arguments to the
            power function. Many power function support ``alternative`` as a
            keyword argument, two-sample test support ``ratio``.

        Returns
        -------
        fig : matplotlib figure instance

        Notes
        -----
        This works only for classes where the ``power`` method has
        ``effect_size``, ``nobs`` and ``alpha`` as the first three arguments.
        If the second argument is ``nobs1``, then the number of observations
        in the plot are those for the first sample.

        -------
        value : float
            The value of the parameter that was set to None in the call. The
            value solves the power equation given the remaining parameters.

            Cache of the result of the root finding procedure for the latest
            call to ``solve_power``, mainly for debugging purposes.
            The first element is the success indicator, one if successful.
            The remaining elements contain the return information of the up to
            three solvers that have been tried.

        Notes
        -----
        The function uses scipy.optimize for finding the value that satisfies
        the power equation. It first uses ``brentq`` with a prior search for
        bounds. If this fails to find a root, ``fsolve`` is used. If ``fsolve``
        also fails, then, for ``alpha``, ``power`` and ``effect_size``,
        ``brentq`` with fixed bounds is used. However, there can still be cases
        where this fails.

            error, that is wrong rejections if the Null Hypothesis is true.
        power : float in interval (0,1)
            power of the test, e.g. 0.8, is one minus the probability of a
            type II error. Power is the probability that the test correctly
            rejects the Null Hypothesis if the Alternative Hypothesis is true.

        Returns
        -------
        value : float
            The value of the parameter that was set to None in the call. The
            value solves the power equation given the remainding parameters.


        Notes
        -----
        The function uses scipy.optimize for finding the value that satisfies
        the power equation. It first uses ``brentq`` with a prior search for
        bounds. If this fails to find a root, ``fsolve`` is used. If ``fsolve``
        also fails, then, for ``alpha``, ``power`` and ``effect_size``,
        ``brentq`` with fixed bounds is used. However, there can still be cases
        where this fails.
