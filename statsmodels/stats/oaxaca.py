Table Summary (summary)

Oaxaca-Blinder is a statistical method that is used to explain
the differences between two mean values. The idea is to show
from two mean values what can be explained by the data and
what cannot by using OLS regression frameworks.

"The original use by Oaxaca's was to explain the wage
differential between two different groups of workers,
but the method has since been applied to numerous other
topics." (Wikipedia)

The model is designed to accept two endogenous response variables
and two exogenous explanitory variables. They are then fit using
the specific type of decomposition that you want.

The method was famously used in Card and Krueger's paper
"School Quality and Black-White Relative Earnings: A Direct Assessment" (1992)

class OaxacaBlinder(object):
    """
    Class to perform Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition.

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog: array_like
        'endog' is the endogenous variable or the dependent variable
        that you are trying to explain.
    exog: array_like
        'exog' is the exogenous variable(s) or the independent variable(s)
        that you are using to explain the endogenous variable.
    bifurcate: int or string
        'bifurcate' is the column of the exogenous variable(s) that you
        wish to split on. This would generally be the group that you wish
        to explain the two means for. Int of the column for a NumPy array
        or int/string for the name of the column in Pandas
    hasconst: bool, optional
        Indicates whether the two exogenous variables include a user-supplied
        constant. If True, a constant is assumed. If False, a constant is added
        at the start. If nothing is supplied, then True is assumed.
    swap: bool, optional
        Imitates the STATA Oaxaca command by allowing users to choose to swap
        groups. Unlike STATA, this is assumed to be True instead of False
    cov_type: string, optional
        See regression.linear_model.RegressionResults for a description of the
        available covariance estimators
    cov_kwdslist or None, optional
        See linear_model.RegressionResults.get_robustcov_results for a
        description required keywords for alternative covariance estimators

    Notes
    -----
    Please check if your data includes at constant. This will still run, but
    will return incorrect values if set incorrectly.

    You can access the models by using their code as an attribute, e.g.,
    _t_model for the total model, _f_model for the first model, _s_model for
    the second model.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import statsmodels.api as sm
    >>> data = sm.datasets.ccards.load()

    '3' is the column of which we want to explain or which indicates
    the two groups. In this case, it is if you rent.
