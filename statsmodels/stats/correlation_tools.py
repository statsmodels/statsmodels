    Find the nearest correlation matrix that is positive semi-definite.

    The function iteratively adjust the correlation matrix by clipping the

    Parameters
    ----------
    corr : ndarray, (k, k)
        initial correlation matrix
    threshold : float
        clipping threshold for smallest eigenvalue, see Notes
    n_fact : int or float

    Notes
    -----
    The smallest eigenvalue of the corrected correlation matrix is

def corr_clipped(corr, threshold=1e-15):
    '''
    Find a near correlation matrix that is positive semi-definite

    This function clips the eigenvalues, replacing eigenvalues smaller than
    the threshold by the threshold. The new matrix is normalized, so that the
    diagonal elements are one.
    Compared to corr_nearest, the distance between the original correlation
    matrix and the positive definite correlation matrix is larger, however,
    it is much faster since it only computes eigenvalues once.

    Parameters
    ----------
    corr : ndarray, (k, k)
        initial correlation matrix
    threshold : float
        clipping threshold for smallest eigenvalue, see Notes

    Returns
    -------
    corr_new : ndarray, (optional)
        corrected correlation matrix


    Notes
    -----
    The smallest eigenvalue of the corrected correlation matrix is
    approximately equal to the ``threshold``. In examples, the
    smallest eigenvalue can be by a factor of 10 smaller than the threshold,
    e.g. threshold 1e-8 can result in smallest eigenvalue in the range
    between 1e-9 and 1e-8.
    If the threshold=0, then the smallest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix
    might be negative, but zero within a numerical error, for example in the
    range of -1e-16.

    Assumes input correlation matrix is symmetric. The diagonal elements of
    returned correlation matrix is set to ones.

    If the correlation matrix is already positive semi-definite given the
    threshold, then the original correlation matrix is returned.

    ``cov_clipped`` is 40 or more times faster than ``cov_nearest`` in simple
    example, but has a slightly larger approximation error.

        fields describing how the optimization terminated

    Example
    -------
    Hard thresholding a correlation matrix may result in a matrix that
    is not positive semidefinite.  We can approximate a hard
    thresholded correlation matrix with a PSD matrix as follows, where
    `cmat` is the input correlation matrix.

    >>> cmat = cmat * (np.abs(cmat) >= 0.3)
    >>> rslt = corr_nearest_factor(cmat, 3)

    Notes
    -----
    A correlation matrix has factor structure if it can be written in
    the form I + XX' - diag(XX'), where X is n x k with linearly
    independent columns, and with each row having sum of squares at
    most equal to 1.  The approximation is made in terms of the
    Frobenius norm.

    This routine is useful when one has an approximate correlation
    matrix that is not SPD, and there is need to estimate the inverse,
    square root, or inverse square root of the population correlation
    matrix.  The factor structure allows these tasks to be done
    without constructing any n x n matrices.

    This is a non-convex problem with no known guaranteed globally
    convergent algorithm for computing the solution.  Borsdof, Higham
    and Raydan (2010) compared several methods for this problem and
    found the spectral projected gradient (SPG) method (used here) to
    perform best.

    The input matrix `mat` can be a dense numpy array or any scipy
    sparse matrix.  The latter is useful if the input matrix is
    obtained by thresholding a very large sample correlation matrix.
    If `mat` is sparse, the calculations are optimized to save memory,
    so no working matrix with more than 10^6 elements is constructed.

    -----
    This routine is useful if one has an estimated correlation matrix
    that is not SPD, and the ultimate goal is to estimate the inverse,
    square root, or inverse square root of the true correlation
    matrix. The factor structure allows these tasks to be performed
    without constructing any n x n matrices.

    The calculations use the fact that if k is known, then X can be
    determined from the eigen-decomposition of mat - k*I, which can in
    turn be easily obtained form the eigen-decomposition of mat.  Thus
    the problem can be reduced to a 1-dimensional search for k that
    does not require repeated eigen-decompositions.

    If the input matrix is sparse, then mat - k*I is also sparse, so
    the eigen-decomposition can be done effciciently using sparse
    routines.

    The one-dimensional search for the optimal value of k is not
    convex, so a local minimum could be obtained.

    This is an alternative to C = np.corrcoef(mat); C *= (np.abs(C) >=
    absmin), suitable for very tall data matrices.

    No intermediate matrix with more than `max_elt` values will be
    constructed.  However memory use could still be high if a large
    number of correlation values exceed `minabs` in magnitude.

    The thresholded matrix is returned in COO format, which can easily
    be converted to other sparse formats.

    Example
    -------
    Here X is a tall data matrix (e.g. with 100,000 rows and 50
    columns).  The row-wise correlation matrix of X is calculated
    and stored in sparse form, with all entries smaller than 0.3
    treated as 0.

    >>> cmat = corr_thresholded(X, 0.3)
