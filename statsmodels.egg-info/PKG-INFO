Description: What Statsmodels is
        ===================
        What it is
        ==========
        
        Statsmodels is a Python package that provides a complement to scipy for statistical computations including descriptive statistics and estimation and inference for statistical models.
        
        Main Features
        =============
        
        * linear regression models: Generalized least squares (including weighted least squares and
          least squares with autoregressive errors), ordinary least squares.
        * glm: Generalized linear models with support for all of the one-parameter
          exponential family distributions.
        * discrete: regression with discrete dependent variables, including Logit, Probit, MNLogit, Poisson, based on maximum likelihood estimators
        * rlm: Robust linear models with support for several M-estimators.
        * tsa: models for time series analysis
          - univariate time series analysis: AR, ARIMA
          - vector autoregressive models, VAR and structural VAR
          - descriptive statistics and process models for time series analysis
        * nonparametric : (Univariate) kernel density estimators
        * datasets: Datasets to be distributed and used for examples and in testing.
        * stats: a wide range of statistical tests
          - diagnostics and specification tests
          - goodness-of-fit and normality tests
          - functions for multiple testing
          - various additional statistical tests
        * iolib
          - Tools for reading Stata .dta files into numpy arrays.
          - printing table output to ascii, latex, and html
        * miscellaneous models
        * sandbox: statsmodels contains a sandbox folder with code in various stages of
          developement and testing which is not considered "production ready".
          This covers among others Mixed (repeated measures) Models, GARCH models, general method
          of moments (GMM) estimators, kernel regression, various extensions to scipy.stats.distributions,
          panel data models, generalized additive models and information theoretic measures.

        0.4.0
        -----
        
        *Main Changes and Additions*
        
        * Added pandas dependency.
        * Cython source is built automatically if cython and compiler are present
        * Support use of dates in timeseries models

          preserving all types. Conversion is much faster now.
        * Improved documentation
        * Models and results are pickleable via save/load, optionally saving the model
          data.
        * Kernel Density Estimation now uses Cython and is considerably faster.

              import statsmodels.api as sm
        
        * model.predict methods signature is now (params, exog, ...) where before
          it assumed that the model had been fit and omitted the params argument.
        * For consistency with other multi-equation models, the parameters of MNLogit
          are now transposed.
        * tools.tools.ECDF -> distributions.ECDF
        * tools.tools.monotone_fn_inverter -> distributions.monotone_fn_inverter

        0.3.0
        -----
        
        *Changes that break backwards compatibility*
        
        Added api.py for importing. So the new convention for importing is::
        
            import statsmodels.api as sm
        
        Importing from modules directly now avoids unnecessary imports and increases
        the import speed if a library or user only needs specific functions.

        * regression.py -> regression/linear_model.py
        * discretemod.py -> discrete/discrete_model.py
        * rlm.py -> robust/robust_linear_model.py
        * glm.py -> genmod/generalized_linear_model.py
        * model.py -> base/model.py
        * t() method -> tvalues attribute (t() still exists but raises a warning)
