About statsmodels
=================

statsmodels is a Python package that provides a complement to scipy for
statistical computations including descriptive statistics and estimation
and inference for statistical models.

Main Features
=============

* Linear regression models:

  - Ordinary least squares
  - Generalized least squares
  - Weighted least squares
  - Least squares with autoregressive errors
  - Quantile regression
  - Recursive least squares

  - Complete StateSpace modeling framework

    - Seasonal ARIMA and ARIMAX models
    - VARMA and VARMAX models
    - Dynamic Factor models
    - Unobserved Component models

  - Hypothesis tests for time series: unit root, cointegration and others
  - Descriptive statistics and process models for time series analysis

* Survival analysis:

  - Proportional hazards regression (Cox models)
  - Survivor function estimation (Kaplan-Meier)
  - Cumulative incidence function estimation

* Multivariate:

  - Principal Component Analysis with missing data
  - Factor Analysis with rotation
  - MANOVA
  - Canonical Correlation

* Nonparametric statistics: Univariate and multivariate kernel density estimators
* Datasets: Datasets used for examples and in testing
* Statistics: a wide range of statistical tests

  - diagnostics and specification tests
  - goodness-of-fit and normality tests
  - functions for multiple testing
  - various additional statistical tests

* Imputation with MICE, regression on order statistic and Gaussian imputation
* Mediation analysis
* Graphics includes plot functions for visual analysis of data and model results

* I/O

  - Tools for reading Stata .dta files, but pandas has a more recent version
  - Table output to ascii, latex, and html

* Miscellaneous models
* Sandbox: statsmodels contains a sandbox folder with code in various stages of
  development and testing which is not considered "production ready".  This covers
  among others

  - Generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators
  - Kernel regression
  - Various extensions to scipy.stats.distributions
  - Panel data models
  - Information theoretic measures
