**Notes**:

* It is essential that you add a test when making code changes. Tests are not 
  needed for doc changes.
* When adding a new function, test values should usually be verified in another package (e.g., R/SAS/Stata).
* When fixing a bug, you must add a test that would produce the bug in master and
  then show that it is fixed with the new code.
* New code additions must be well formatted. Changes should pass flake8. If on Linux or OSX, you can
  verify you changes are well formatted by running 
  ```
  git diff upstream/master -u -- "*.py" | flake8 --diff --isolated
  ```
  assuming `flake8` is installed. This command is also available on Windows 
  using the Windows System for Linux once `flake8` is installed in the 
  local Linux environment. While passing this test is not required, it is good practice and it help 
  improve code quality in `statsmodels`.
* Docstring additions must render correctly, including escapes and LaTeX.
