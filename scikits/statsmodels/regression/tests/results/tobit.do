* linear prediction
predict xb
* standard error of the prediction
* which can be
* thought of as the standard error of the predicted expected value or
* mean for the observation's covariate pattern.  The standard error of
* the prediction is also referred to as the standard error of the
* fitted value.
predict stdp, stdp
* calculates Pr(a < xb + u < b), the probability that y|x would be
* observed in the interval (a,b). Takes inf and neg. inf
predit pr2535, pr(25,35)
* calculates E(xb + u | a < xb + u < b), the expected value of y|x
* conditional on y|x being in the interval (a,b), meaning that y|x is
* censored.
predict e2535, e(25, 35)
* calculates E(y*), where y* = a if xb + u < a, y* = b if
* xb + u > b, and y* = xb+u otherwise, meaning that y* is truncated.
predict ystar2535, ystar(25, 35)
* calculates equation-level score variables.
* The first new variable will contain the derivative of the log
* likelihood with respect to the regression equation.
* The second new variable will contain the derivative of the log
* likelihood with respect to the scale equation (sigma).
