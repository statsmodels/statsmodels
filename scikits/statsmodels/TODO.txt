Tests
----------
Test I/O of models wrt array types, dimensions
    - add checks in all top class for data
Make sure all tests actually run...
    -some problems with removing imports from __init__ have been hidden

Issues
----------
Make sure all results are computed where they should be
Need to clip mu's in GLM to avoid np.log(0), etc. (done for gamma)

Other cleanup
--------------------
Check all imports, cut out what's not needed


Update all examples/docstrings
Make sure docs examples run
Run lint
Technical docs (theory, references, formulas)
Make a recarray dataset and masked dataset for testing and development

Put inheritance structure in docs, note where attributes/methods of parent class
    are overwritten.

Rename bse
Add tvalues attribute to results instead of calling t method?
